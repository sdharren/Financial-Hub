# 👋Welcome to Financial-Hub
Our application is designed to provide users with a comprehensive overview of their financial status, including investments, general spending, and cryptocurrency assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. We have integrated several APIs, including Plaid, BlockCypher, ForexPython, and YFinance, to enable users to link a range of financial institutions and crypto wallets, view their financial data in various types of charts, and gain valuable insights into their finances.

Our team has constructed a REST Framework from scratch to link the backend view functionalities and database in Django to the React frontend using custom endpoints and efficient design principles. We have optimized the application's rendering and display of financial data, ensuring a seamless user experience. The consumption of the REST API in React follows SOLID design principles, using custom hooks and props to handle request creation, query the API and handle the result, as well as return the data. Every one of our dashboard components has had the logic refactored into custom hooks, following the single responsibility principle.

To improve the performance of our application, we have implemented a caching system that guarantees quick responses to user requests. Our view functions are designed to handle any issues that may arise with the caching system, and we have included backup options to retrieve data from the various APIs in case of errors.

We are confident that our Financial-Hub web application will provide you with the tools you need to manage your finances effectively
